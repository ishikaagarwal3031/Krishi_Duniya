# Krishi_Duniya

A Website named as 'Krishi Duniya' is an initiative taken by our team 'Kickstarters' where we are making farmers more oriented to farming methods through educational videos, aware of govt. schemes available for them and connnecting all big merchandises under a single umbrella. 
This project was built at 'Smart City Hackathon' which made us to finals!
The complete webpage is build in Hindi language to let farmers understand easily. Also, it has feature to view webpage in both dark and light modes which makes it more interesting.
